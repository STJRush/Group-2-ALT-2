                                                 Preparation 
In the ALT 2 project which is about analytics there will be a lot of preparation. First of all we had to practice 
coding different types of code which we might find useful in our project for example we did code which cleaned, 
plotted, read and write data which might be useful in the ALT 2. We also had to look for data which we wanted to 
use and we found data in google datasets. We came up with a countryâ€™s gdp vs % spent on education.
